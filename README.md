# TODO
- Contract testing
- Merge Read App & Read Infra?
- Move port param and result closer to usage (VO or just below port)
- Check naming everywhere
- Redirect to /accounts after successful synchronization
- Auto formatting tool
- Display account balance of given month (along with transactions)
- Balance date hard-coded to `2020-01-01`
- Categorization table background is white
- Change transaction category -> dropdown list with search?
- Prevent deletion of used category
- Category deduplication
- Allow to rename budget (in its own use case though)
- Change budget amount implies providing begin date
- Synchronization allows multiple files to be uploaded but only one is working
- Better date display in transactions of month (month and year are redundant)
- Introduce `CurrentMonth` of something like that to replace `new DateOnly(DateTime.Now.Year, DateTime.Now.Month, 1)`
- Clear all `EditForm` on save so that next create only has placeholders and not previously saved values
